## 👋 Hi! I'm Mohamed Nasreldin
Computer Science Student • Backend Developer • Language-Learning Enthusiast


🚀 Who Am I?

I'm a third-year Computer Science student with a strong passion for backend development, cybersecurity, and AI.
My journey started with mastering Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and building full-stack applications — and has since expanded into learning Python, exploring operating systems, and deepening my understanding of networking and security.

I love building things that solve real problems, whether it’s a microservice, a security tool, or a productivity app.

💡 What I’m Working On
🔸 Language Learning App (Side Project)

I’m currently building a flashcard-like language learning application to store and review translated words — a real project I’m using to learn both Python and improve my German.
