## 👋 Hi! I'm Mohamed Nasreldin
Computer Science Student • Backend Developer • Language-Learning Enthusiast


🚀 Who Am I?

I'm a third-year Computer Science student with a strong passion for backend development, cybersecurity, and AI.
My journey started with mastering Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and building full-stack applications — and has since expanded into learning Python, exploring operating systems, and deepening my understanding of networking and security.

I love building things that solve real problems, whether it’s a microservice, a security tool, or a productivity app.

💡 What I’m Working On
🔸 Language Learning App (Side Project)

I’m currently building a flashcard-like language learning application to store and review translated words — a real project I’m using to learn both Python and improve my German.
This app also includes:

A backend for saving and organizing vocab

Translation features

Plans for a desktop frontend

🔸 Studying Python Through Practical Development

The app is part of my goal to become comfortable creating Python-based tools, scripts, and APIs.

🔸 Running My Own Home Server

I’m experimenting with:

Hosting personal applications

Handling deployment environments

Understanding networking and system administration in practice

This helps me understand how backend systems behave outside of a local environment.
